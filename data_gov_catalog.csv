The archived data includes base data and derived products of the National Weather Service (NWS) Weather Surveillance Radar 88 Doppler (WSR-88D) next generation (NEXRAD) weather radar.  Weather radar detects the three meteorological base data quantities: reflectivity, mean radial velocity, and spectrum width.  From these quantities, computer processing generates numerous meteorological analysis products for forecasts, archiving and dissemination.  There are 159 operational  NEXRAD radar systems deployed throughout the United States and at selected overseas locations.  At the Radar Operations Center (ROC) in Norman OK, personnel from the NWS, Air Force, Navy, and FAA use this distributed weather radar system to collect the data needed to warn of impending severe weather and possible flash floods; support air traffic safety and assist in the management of air traffic flow control; facilitate resource protection at military bases; and optimize the management of water, agriculture, forest, and snow removal.

For 2001, instead of a survey of chief prosecutors, a census of all 2,341 chief prosecutors who handled felony cases in state courts of general jurisdiction was conducted. A chief prosecutor is an official, usually locally elected and typically with the title of district attorney or county attorney, who is in charge of a prosecutorial district made up of one or more counties, and who conducts or supervises the prosecution of felony cases in a state court system. Prosecutors in courts of limited jurisdiction, such as municipal prosecutors, were not included in the survey. The census' purpose was to obtain detailed descriptive information on prosecutors' offices, as well as information on their policies and practices. Variables cover staffing, funding, special categories of felony prosecutions, caseload, juvenile matters, work-related threats or assaults, the use of DNA evidence, and community-related activities, such as involvement in neighborhood associations.

It was implemented to improve the availability of data needed for improving vehicle safety performance and reducing deaths related to vehicles in transport. The Agency's goal is to reduce fatal injuries resulting from motor vehicle crashes to a rate of 1.0 fatalities per 100M VMT from the current rate of 1.5. It is the only national census data system for fatal vehicle crashes. FARS is extensively referenced to support legislation, enforcement and education programs designed to reduce injury and property damage resulting from motor vehicle crashes. The FARS data are used by virtually all traffic safety professionals and other customers interested in traffic safety including: Congress, NHTSA, USDOT, State agencies, the automotive industry, the insurance industry, advocacy groups, international users, and the general public. The FARS data support customers' most significant programs that address traffic safety. It is the basis for the Agency's traffic safety grants to the States for programs such as the Impaired Driver Program. FARS collects State level data for analysis of traffic safety crashes to identify problems and evaluate countermeasures designed to reduce injuries and property damage resulting from motor vehicle crashes. The data are used for agency rulemaking and targeting grant money to areas most in need. The types of data collected can be used specifically to conduct research on ways to remediate problems such as alcohol involvement, vehicle types, weather and road conditions, seat belt use, car seats, air bags. The program provides analytical data and information to the public through various media, including the program's web services. The program is able to target data collections to respond to the most recent Congressional interest and mandates for new data. The Information Technology component provides for support for operations and maintenance of the program's data collection application, client server platform, and communications network that is consistent with the Agency's architecture and standards. Without the FARS program and data, many of the legislative actions, enforcement, and education programs designed to save lives and reduce traffic safety related injuries and property damage could not be targeted, affected, or enacted.",Tool Catalog,Statistical,"fatal vehicle crashes, fatality analysis  traffic safety","Death certificate data, EMS data, Race..etc.",<a href="http://www-fars.nhtsa.dot.gov">http://www-fars.nhtsa.dot.gov</a>,<a href="http://www-fars.nhtsa.dot.gov/Main/index.aspx">http://www-fars.nhtsa.dot.gov/Main/index.aspx</a>,Crash  / Vehicle  / driver /person,longitude/latitude pair,Degrees/Minutes/Seconds,"phone; paper; computer;  web(Google alter), news, fax, State Records Files",Web application,<a href="http://www-fars.nhtsa.dot.gov/Main/index.aspx">http://www-fars.nhtsa.dot.gov/Main/index.aspx</a>; <a href="ftp://ftp.nhtsa.dot.gov/FARS/FARS-DOC/">ftp://ftp.nhtsa.dot.gov/FARS/FARS-DOC/</a>,Departement of Transportation - National Highway Traffice Safety Administration,Yes,Yes,<a href="http://www-fars.nhtsa.dot.gov/Main/index.aspx">http://www-fars.nhtsa.dot.gov/Main/index.aspx</a>; <a href="ftp://ftp.nhtsa.dot.gov/FARS/FARS-DOC/">ftp://ftp.nhtsa.dot.gov/FARS/FARS-DOC/</a>,,,Census data,Census data,Used Monthly Fatality Counts (state estimate) and FastFARS counts (early notification) to estimate FARS (MDE) counts.,"Data element (weight factor): Mandatory (4), Key (3),  Common (2), Supplemental (1)",,,,Blank Data Element Rating: Starting Score - (Blank Mandatory * 4) - (Blank Key * 3) - (Blank Common * 2) ?

The Visible Human Project has its roots in the Library's 1986 Long-Range Plan. The plan recommended that NLM should ""...thoroughly and systematically investigate the technical requirements for and feasibility of instituting a biomedical images library."" It encouraged the NLM to consider building and disseminating medical image libraries much the same way it acquires, indexes, and provides access to the biomedical literature. It foresaw a coming era where NLM's bibliographic and factual database services would be complemented by libraries of digital images, distributed over high-speed computer networks and by high-capacity physical media. Not surprisingly, it saw an increasing role for electronically represented images in clinical medicine and biomedical research. Early in 1989, under the direction of the Board of Regents, an adhoc planning panel was convened to explore the proper role for NLM in the rapidly changing field of electronic imaging. After much deliberation, the NLM Planning Panel on Electronic Image Libraries made the following recommendation: ""NLM should undertake a first project building a digital image library of volumetric data representing a complete, normal adult male and female.  This Visible Human Project will include digitized photographic images for cryosectioning, digital images derived from computerized tomography and digital magnetic resonance images of cadavers."" The Visible Human Project is acquiring images from representative male and female cadavers.

http://www.data.gov/details/1336,ToxCast Phase I,Environmental Protection Agency,,Science and Technology,12/21/2009,12/21/2009,NA,NA,"Background: Chemical toxicity testing is being transformed by advances in biology and computer modeling, concerns over animal use and the thousands of environmental chemicals lacking toxicity data. EPA's ToxCast program aims to address these concerns by screening and prioritizing chemicals for potential human toxicity using in vitro assays and in silico approaches.  Objectives: This project aims to evaluate the use of in vitro assays for understanding the types of molecular and pathway perturbations caused by environmental chemicals and to build initial prioritization models of in vivo toxicity.   Methods: We tested 309 mostly pesticide active chemicals in 467 assays across 9 technologies, including high-throughput cell-free assays and cell-based assays in multiple human primary cells and cell lines, plus rat primary hepatocytes. Both individual and composite scores for effects on genes and pathways were analyzed.   Results: Chemicals display a broad spectrum of activity at the molecular and pathway levels. Many expected interactions are seen, including endocrine and xenobiotic metabolism enzyme activity. Chemicals range in promiscuity across pathways, from no activity to affecting dozens of pathways. We find a statistically significant inverse association between the number of pathways perturbed by a chemical at low in vitro concentrations and the lowest in vivo dose at which a chemical causes toxicity. We also find associations between a small set in vitro assays and rodent liver lesion formation.  Conclusions: This approach promises to provide meaningful data on the thousands of untested environmental chemicals, and to guide targeted testing of environmental contaminants.",Raw Data Catalog,Research,"Toxicology, In vitro screening, prioritization, cancer, ToxCast, Tox21, toxic, toxicity, chemical, compound, pesticide, pollution, pollutant, environment, contaminant, test","Judson RS, Houck KA, Kavlock RJ, Knudsen TB, Martin MT, Mortensen HM, et al. 2009.

The 2006 Census of Jail Facilities gathered data from all jail detention facilities holding inmates beyond arraignment, a period normally exceeding 72 hours. Jail facilities were operated by cities and counties, by private entities under contract to correctional authorities, and by the Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP). Excluded from the census were physically separate temporary holding facilities such as drunk tanks and police lockups that do not hold persons after being formally charged in court. Also excluded were state-operated facilities in Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Rhode Island, Vermont, and Alaska, which have combined jail-prison systems.

The NCVS was designed with four primary objectives: (1) to develop detailed information about the victims and consequences of crime, (2) to estimate the number and types of crimes both reported and not reported to the police, (3) to provide uniform measures of selected types of crimes, and (4) to permit comparisons over time and types of areas. The survey categorizes crimes as ""personal"" or ""property."" Personal crimes include rape and sexual assault, robbery, aggravated and simple assault, and purse-snatching/pocket-picking, while property crimes include burglary, theft, motor vehicle theft, and vandalism. Each respondent is asked a series of screen questions designed to determine whether she or he was victimized during the six-month period preceding the interview. A ""household respondent"" is also asked to report on crimes against the household as a whole (e.g., burglary, motor vehicle theft). The data include type of crime, month, time, and location of the crime, relationship between victim and offender, characteristics of the offender, self-protective actions taken by the victim during the incident and results of those actions, consequences of the victimization, type of property lost, whether the crime was reported to police and reasons for reporting or not reporting, and offender use of weapons, drugs, and alcohol.

This program described the characteristics and counts of prison inmates during each calendar year. Since its initiation, responsibility for this program has shifted among several agencies -- in 1950 it was transferred to the Federal Bureau of Prisons and to the Law Enforcement Assistance Administration in 1971. Since 1972, the Bureau of Census, under agreement with the Department of Justice, has had responsibility for compiling the statistical data.

Prior to January 21, 2010, this data was not available. The data include fails-to-deliver in equity securities. The values of total fails-to-deliver shares represent the aggregate net balance of shares that failed to be delivered as of a particular settlement date. Fails to deliver on a given day are a cumulative number of all fails outstanding until that day, plus new fails that occur that day, less fails that settle that day. The figure is not a daily amount of fails, but a combined figure that includes both new fails on the reporting day as well as existing fails. In other words, these numbers reflect aggregate fails as of a specific point in time, and may have little or no relationship to yesterday's aggregate fails. Thus, it is important to note that the age of fails cannot be determined by looking at these numbers.

Terra's orbit around the Earth is timed so that it passes from north to south across the equator in the morning, while Aqua passes south to north over the equator in the afternoon. Terra MODIS and Aqua MODIS are viewing the entire Earth's surface every 1 to 2 days, acquiring data in 36 spectral bands, or groups of wavelengths (see MODIS Technical Specifications). This map shows the temperature of Earth's lands during the nighttime. Temperature is a measure of how warm or cold an object is. During the day, the Sun's rays warm Earth's lands. At night, the lands typically cool off. Landscapes cool off at night because they release their warmth to air above while they are no longer receiving sunlight. Scientists can measure the temperature of Earth's lands from space using instruments carried on satellites. Scientists want to know the land's temperature for many important reasons. For example, in places where it is too hot or too cold food crops may die. Temperature also influences weather and climate patterns. So, mapping the temperature of Earth's lands helps scientists to better understand our world.  The colors on these maps represent temperature patterns of the top millimeter (or skin) of the land surface including bare land, snow or ice cover, urban areas, and cropland or forest canopy as observed by MODIS in clear-sky conditions for the time period indicated. Yellow shows the warmest temperatures (up to 45C) and light blue shows the coldest temperatures (down to -25C).

These habitats include seagrasses or submerged aquatic vegetation that are found in the intertidal and subtidal zones of estuaries and near shore coastal waters. Some deepwater reef communities (coral or tuberficid worm reefs) have also been excluded from the inventory. These habitats, because of their depth, go undetected by aerial imagery.

This data set represents the extent, approximate location and type of wetlands and deepwater habitats in the conterminous United States. These data delineate the areal extent of wetlands and surface waters as defined by Cowardin et al. (1979).       Certain wetland habitats are excluded from the National mapping program because of the limitations of aerial imagery as the primary data source used to detect wetlands. These habitats include seagrasses or submerged aquatic vegetation that are found in the intertidal and subtidal zones of estuaries and near shore coastal waters. Some deepwater reef communities (coral or tuberficid worm reefs) have also been excluded from the inventory. These habitats, because of their depth, go undetected by aerial imagery.       By policy, the Service also excludes certain types of ""farmed wetlands"" as may be defined by the Food Security Act or that do not coincide with the Cowardin et al. definition. Contact the Service's Regional Wetland Coordinator for additional information on what types of farmed wetlands are included on wetland maps.     Purpose: The present goal of the Service is to provide the citizens of the United States and its Trust Territories with current geospatially referenced information on the status, extent, characteristics and functions of wetlands, riparian, deepwater and related aquatic habitats in priority areas to promote the understanding and conservation of these resources.     Supplemental_Information: The wetland maps were produced as topical overlays using U.S. Geological Survey topographic maps as the base. The hard copy product is a composite map showing topographic and planimetric features from the USGS map base and wetlands and deepwater habitats from the Service's topical overlay. Thus, the data are intended for use in publications, at a scale of 1:24,000 or smaller. Due to the scale, the primary intended use is for regional and watershed data display and analysis, rather than specific project data analysis. The map products were neither designed or intended to represent legal or regulatory products.

The source of this information is the annual Federal Fleet Report published by GSA's Office of Governmentwide Policy (OGP). Every year Federal agencies report inventory, cost, utilization, and fuel consumption data for their fleet operations using the Federal Automotive Statistical Tool (FAST), a web-based reporting tool jointly funded and managed by OGP and the Department of Energy's Federal Energy Management Program. Data are reported in FAST for every category of vehicle: passenger, light truck, medium truck, bus, ambulance, etc. Data are aggregated for foreign and domestic fleets, and also by how vehicles were originally acquired: purchased, commercially leased, or leased from the GSA Fleet program. These data form the basis for each agency's annual fleet budget justification under OMB Circular A-11, and are used by policymakers and legislators for various other purposes. Contractors, fleet service vendors, researchers, and libraries also make use of the annual Federal Fleet Report.
